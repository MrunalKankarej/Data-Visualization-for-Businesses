# Data-Visualization-for-Businesses

###### Description: 
###### I undertook this visualization project aspart of my internship simulation, on Forage, with Tata Motors

## Project Overview
Developed data-driven insights for an online retail store, focusing on revenue growth factors, operational efficiency, and marketing effectiveness. Identified high-performing products and key customer segments while recommending strategies for expansion and enhanced decision-making based on demographic and performance metrics.

##Technology Implemented
- Microsoft Excel - Data Cleaning
- Microsoft PowerBI - Data Manipulation and Visualization

## Task Overview

### Step 1: Planning
- Developed questions for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Finance Officer to understand the specific requirements of the business.
- Examined the requirements of each question to determine most suitable graphing tools for visualization.

### Step 2: Data Cleaning
- Examined over 540000 rows of sales data in Microsoft Excel  to preprocess it for analysis. This involved:
- Removing any null or out-of-bound (negative) values
- Data formatting
- Reducing redundent features from the dataset to increase clarity

### Step 3: Data Visualization and Modelling
Before presenting the final results from the analysis process to the leadership team, I also imported the data to Microsoft PowerBI, to build develop visuals to support the insights drawn. This involved building 'Measures' in PowerBI to develop more comprehensive graphs and organization of charts into implementable action plans.


### Step 4: Presentation:
Communicating the insights derived from the data preprocessing, modelling and visualization stages to the clients.
